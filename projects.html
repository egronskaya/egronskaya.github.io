          During my PhD, I studied the way attention and intrinsic stimulus saliency are intertwined in rats’ auditory cortex. It was incredible to see the animals’ behaviour paralleled by changes in the brain – another creature’s perception becoming tangible. That’s the unique and lucky spot in which neuroscientists have landed, with tools to tackle concepts previously restricted to the philosophers’ realm: awareness, sensation, choice, and will.
